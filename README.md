# UNBIASED NEWS BASED ON GEO LOCATION
# Motivation 
This project is basically motivated by the aspect that nowadays we have very limited unbiased news sources, so we are trying to give the news events based on user's stories. Now each user in our app has the authority to take and post pictures of events which are harmful or can cause harm to other users, once these pictures are posted they will be geo tagged and time stamped by our app which can be viewed by other user and they can save themselves by knowing about these events before even going to the place where the  event is taking place. Our motivation for this project is to save people from these events thus saving there a lot of time and money. The events can include traffic jam, Road blocked, Roads on fire, accidents on roads, fallen trucks, kidnapping, rally, protests, crimes etc. If people get to know about these events in real time so they can take the other road or the same road and different direction, this will not only save their time and money but will also keep them safe while they are travelling.
# Overview
# Significance of the Project

This project deals not only with saving time and money of its users but also keep them safe while they are travelling by road either through any means. Thus our app is highly useful for its users because it notify them about the dangers of roads before they even went on it. If a road is blocked the user will not go through that road instead of hitting that road and then taking another turn and wasting his time and money. If a person has been mugged or robbed he will notify the other users about that this place is unsafe at this particular time. Similarly if an accident has been taken place due to which the traffic is immensely jammed the users of this app will notify other user through our app. This is the core idea of our app and it will save people from getting caught up by these situations. we can continue our work after the academics because this application is also useful for everyday use in a city like Karachi where anything can happen at any time.  Difficulty arises when multiple users are posting about the same event thus leaving other users confused we will cluster multiple post of the same events into one plus verification is also necessary that the event that has been posted by one of the user is correct or not. There is another difficulty which can arise due to the in expertise about the recommendations being given accurately. 

# Description of the Project 
Our app deals with saving time and money of people and giving them protection. One user can post picture of an event which can be viewed by other users. The picture must be clicked and posted which will be posted by our app mentioning the location and the time when and where it was taken. The app is basically providing our users with the unbiased news. The news that it provides has been published or forecasted by the same or other users thus if multiple user are posting or mentioning the same event we can thus judge the correctness of it.  This feature is the core idea of the project.

Other features include that our app recommend or suggest user shops, restaurants, gyms, clubs etc. consider one user frequently visits to X place based on geo location then our app will suggest him/her the similar kind or types of places that the person frequently or mostly visits. Our app will also notify the user about the deals or the new arrivals of the places they have visited and also of the places they haven’t visited and are most likely to visit. Once the user has gone to a certain place (restaurant, shop etc.) he will provide feedback of the place so according to that feedback, his likes and check in his preferences will be set. We can also earn money by suggesting some outlet new arrivals. 

Another feature is that our app will notify its user about an event for example a concert, festival or party near the user with its details that the user can be most likely interested in thus by advertising about the events we can earn money through different event organization. There is another feature which includes the event management aspect. We have planned to give two types of accounts to the users. One is basic account and the other one is premium account. The user having the premium account can publish their events while the users with can see and join the events.

# FYPModules
Final Year Project
Project descriptionThe Problem is trying to solve our FYP is that, the user aware what is happening around him in his area or his locality.With the help of user uploading live feeds or picture of the story. Basically, we create a social type Android application which helps out user to know is there a traffic jam in XYZ area or not, is there a new sale or deals occur in a shop or hotel or restaurant and other thing as well.
Module1:In which, I built up a platform where user upload their news feeds. So the technology used for this purpose is android studio and for database purpose used Firebase. Also used in other api's like when user upload feed then he gives the picture or video which they capture on that time, the title and the description. When the user clicks an upload button, then on news feed automatically the geotagging of that place and time appeared. So api's used for this purpose are Picasso for images, retrofit for uploading videos, google map api.
Module2:In which, I build up a platform where user broadcast their event using live-streaming. The WOWZA Streaming Engine used for this purpose. In which we used two protocol RTSP (real time Streaming Protocol) and RTMP (real time messaging protocol). In RTSP, the user upload live streaming on the server (Wowza) by using this protocol and RTMP used for uploading live streaming into home page where all the users see the live streaming. 
Module3:In which, I build up a server where the admin track all the registered user activities means they have an authority to find out no of like, no of dislike, no of post and other things. The reason behind for creating the server is that, if the user uploads a false feed and other stuff. If the dislike margin, which are set on every post exceeded, then the server automatically remove this post and also warn a user do not post any un-relevant post in future. If the user does this again the server simply removes it.
